# LinguPath-uniproject
A SymPy based equation solver and function plotter.

To run the program, open a terminal and enter:
  python3 [path-to-the-project-folder]/main.py

This program is purely command based. Enter "help" to get every defined command and syntax structure.
There may be future updates. For now, I'm not working on any expansion but feel free to submit pull requests!
